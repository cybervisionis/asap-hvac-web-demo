## Current Situation & Needs

- No public website or consistent online presence found (only a Facebook post discovered).  
- Interested in automation to reduce paperwork and manual processes.  Specifically:
  - Quote generation
  - Scheduling and appointment management
  - Invoicing and payment processing
  - Customer tracking/CRM

## Proposal Ideas (high level)

- Digital transformation: automate quote → job → invoice workflows to reduce administrative time and speed response to customers.
- Simple brand and website: create a clean, mobile-first site with:
  - Home / hero section
  - Services offered (repairs, installations, ductwork, maintenance, plumbing support)
  - Testimonials
  - Contact and service area
  - Online quote request form
- Quote & scheduling system: interactive quote tool that produces a printable/emailable estimate and creates a scheduled job in the admin view.
- Payments & invoicing: integrate a test-mode payment option (Stripe/PayPal) and automatic invoice generation.
- CRM basics: store customer records, job history, and communications for follow-up.
- Training & handoff: provide simple admin screens and training materials so the team can manage quotes and schedules.

## Recommended MVP (what to build first)

1. Responsive one-page website with clear contact and services.  
2. Quote request form with basic pricing models (JSON-backed) and an estimated quote output.  
3. Simple admin view listing incoming quote requests and scheduled demo appointments.  
4. Simulated payment flow (demo-only, no live charges) and invoice PDF export.
5. This is a demo!  I dont have all the info yet.  This is a surprise.  Everything I know is to thie point is in this document.  If the info needed isnt found use generate it based on what you do know.

## Next Steps (recommended)

1. Draft a short proposal and mockup to show Anthony (1–2 page PDF + live demo link).  
2. Confirm contact details, service area, and any baseline pricing or common job types.  
3. Build and deploy a static prototype (HTML/CSS/JS) to the provided Azure Web App (`app-asapHvac`) for a live demo.  
4. Walk through the demo with Anthony, collect feedback, then convert to a scoped SOW.
